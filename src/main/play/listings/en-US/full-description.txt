This app adds Clark County C-TRAN buses information to MonTransit.

This app provides the buses schedule as well as the latest rider alerts and news from www.c-tran.com and @ctranvancouver on Twitter.

C-TRAN buses serve Battle Ground, Camas, Vancouver and Washougal in Clark County, Washington and Portland, Oregon, United States.

Once this application is installed, the MonTransit app will display buses information (schedule...).

This application only has a temporary icon: download the MonTransit app (free) in the "More ..." section bellow or by following this Google Play link http://goo.gl/pCk5mV

You can install this application on the SD card but it is not recommended.

The information comes from the GTFS file provided by the Clark County Public Transit Benefit Area (C-TRAN).
